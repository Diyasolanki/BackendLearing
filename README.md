I am currently diving deep into backend development, aiming to explore various backend languages and tools. As part of my learning process, I decided to build something practical and engagingâ€”a RESTful API for managing Olympic player data.

Steps to Set Up the Backend:

1. Folder Structure : Begin by organizing your project folder structure. I've created an efficient structure that you can follow.
2. Initialize the Project : Open the terminal and run the following command to create a package.json file: npm init -y
3. Install Dependencies : Install the necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file to get started with your project.
4. Set Up Express and Database Connection : Create a connection using Express and set up your database connection.
5. Create Schema and Model : Define the Schema and Model for your data. Make sure to export them for future use.
6. Create Routes for Requests : Design the routers to handle all types of requests using a single URL.
   Define the various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations and test them using Postman.
7. Register in index.js : To display data on the screen, register your configurations in the index.js file.
    Add: app.use(express.json()); 
          app.use(routers);
8. Middleware for JSON Parsing : When sending data via Postman or any other tool, it's often in JSON format. Without express.json(), Express won't know how to read  the incoming JSON data. This middleware ensures that the body of the request is parsed and accessible via req.body.
    
9. Order of Middleware : It's essential to place app.use(express.json()) before the route definitions. This ensures that the request body is parsed before any other logic is processed.
 
10. Test Your API :After setting everything up, use Postman or another testing tool to ensure your API works smoothly. Verify that all routes and methods function as expected.
